These Libraries are an ongoing effort to ease the work on .NET, including a backport/polyfill/bridge of recent .NET features to .NET 2.0, .NET Core 1.0, .NET Standard 1.0, among other things.

Theraot.Core is as close as I am to a ".NET Compatibility Pack" capable to provide a uniform API surface for many .NET platforms.
